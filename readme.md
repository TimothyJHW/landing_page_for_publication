# Pure Sugar T Shirt Landing Page

This is a single page, 4 screen landing page designed to sell print on demand t shirts, through Amazon. The design is original and the tshirt is authentic and can be ordered through Amazon.com (US customers only).

## Page 1
This is the main landing page, and as such is a single screen shot of the tshirt in a holiday setting designed to set the product in an open and pleasurable environment. The first page has to catch the user's attention and sell the product to keep the visitor on the page.

To the left there is a simple slogan and button to move the user to the next page. A navigation section at the top of the page, allows the user to scroll to any of the four screens.

## Page 2
This is the area featuring models wearing the tshirt. For responsiveness purposes copy is to kept to the minimum of simple slogans. The images expand when clicked allowing the user to examine the product more closely.

A footer reminds the customer that the tshirt is bought through Amazon with all of the customer security that implies.

## Page 3
This page features a copy of the tshirt and some copy detailing its features. The same footer provides visual balance to the page, framing the product and giving a solid base. It also leaves room for special promotions in the future. At the moment there is, again, the reminder that the customer has Amazon security standing behind the purchase.

Social media icons are available, and click-thru to the main social media sites, and a buy button is included which clicks through to Amazon.com where the tshirt can actually be purchased.
